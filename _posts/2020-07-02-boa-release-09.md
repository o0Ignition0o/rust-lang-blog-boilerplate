title: "How Rust helps us move faster - v0.9"
author: Boa Developers
---

Roughly every month to 6 weeks we have a new version of Boa. Today we're please to announce our latest release, version 0.9.  
The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.

## Better tooling for profiling

Boa became the first Rust project to make use of [measureme](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme), this was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. Luckily the framework is in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release we gave it a try.  
Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.

We took it for a spin (which you'll see in Object Specialization).

Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called `summarize`

```
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| Item                       | Self time | % of total time | Time     | Item count |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| From<Object>               | 1.04ms    | 14.776          | 1.04ms   | 146        |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| new_object                 | 356.50µs  | 5.082           | 533.50µs | 18         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| create_instrinsics         | 263.50µs  | 3.756           | 6.38ms   | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| make_builtin_fn: toString  | 218.50µs  | 3.114           | 290.50µs | 12         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| String                     | 81.60µs   | 1.163           | 961.60µs | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+

## Object Specialization

In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in `internal slots`. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, then the values themselves were `JSValue`s. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) by using the native [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html) as a backing store, this would not be possible.

By removing

The headline feature this release is the Object Specialization @HalidOdat worked on, this makes it easier to use Rust primitives instead of going back and forth between JS values and Rust values.
You can see below the biggest slow down was setting properties on `JSValues`. By specializing some of our built-in objects we can bypass that entirely, the after image shows the result!
